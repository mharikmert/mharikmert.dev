  I'm a 4th grade Computer Science and Engineering Student at Marmara University in Turkey. I'm passionate about full-stack software development with modern tools and languages. I enjoy being challenged and engaging with projects that require me to work outside of my comfort zone and knowledge set.  Besides, I'm also a Software Engineer Intern at <a target = "_blank" href = "https://www.ambeent.ai"> Ambeent Inc.</a>
